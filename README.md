# Provenance

Udpate Argonaut Data Query DSTU2 IG to FHIR Version R4.

Description: The Argonaut experience dictates clear guidance requires real implementation and testing. For this project, the Argonaut Provenance gudiance will be developed with the goal of having consistency among implementers to meet the [USCDI requirements](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/us-core-data-interoperability-uscdi). The final guidance will be added to the Argonaut Data Query R4, and ultimately US Core.
